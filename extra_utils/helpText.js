Hi! My name is Sad Robot, I'm the resident MTG bot for ${guildname}.

I'm here to fetch MTG cards for you. I will look for any cards that are formatted like [[cardname]]!
You can specify as many cards as you'd like and I'll try to fetch them as fast as I can. Please be mindful
not to spam the chat though!

To get my help text for all of my functions, just type ?help either here or in ${guildname}.
